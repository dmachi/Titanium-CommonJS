Titanium-CommonJS

A Synchronous CommonJS Loader Module for Titanium Desktop and eventually some core CommonJS modules which use 
the existing Titanium modules for low level functionality (system, file, etc).

Installation

Installation is pretty easy, but somewhat wierd and possibly unusable in practice at the moment.  
There are no docs for creating custom modules for the Titanium Desktop, so while it is working in
basic form and doesn't require on any new low level support, it is only usable in development until 
Appcelerator clues us in. Directions are for Mac, but should work more or less the same in windows
after changing the paths.

	- create a /Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/commonjs directory.  

	- Checkout a copy of git@github.com:dmachi/Titanium-CommonJS.git and place it in the above 
	directory with a name like 1.0.0 where 1.0.0 is the version of the Titanium SDK you are using.  
	You should end up with /Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/commonjs/1.0.0/commonjsmodule.js

This is essentially all of the installation currently required for the loader itself.  It will currently search in 
your applications Resources/CommonJS folder when you require dependencies. Loading a resource looks like:

(in my Resources index.html)
<script type="text/javascript">
	var Bleh = Titanium.CommonJS.require("foo/bar").Bleh	
</script>

Within CommonJS modules themselves, require() can be used by itself, but 'require()' isn't available in the root
context.  Be sure to use the Titanium.CommonJS.require() in those cases.
